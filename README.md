### Funny Story About Geometry Teacher And The Student

The geometry teacher said that it was impossible to trisect an angle with just a compass and straightedge. One of the students said: “I’ve seen it done.”

The teacher responded: “You’re mistaken.”

The student said: “When I get to heaven, I’m going to ask Euclid.”

The teacher responded: “What if Euclid went to hell?”

“Then you can ask him.” The student said.
